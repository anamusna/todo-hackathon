                      Modern   and   feature-rich   web   applications   need   a   lot   of   code   to   be  
                      written,  if  build  with  plain  JavaScript  and  jQuery  only. 
                      Today's   JavaScript   frameworks,   like   React,   simplify   many   common   tasks  
                      and   are   a   powerful   tool   to   build   single   page   applications   (SPA)   that  
                      are  faster  and  more  flexible  than  the  old  page-reload.

                      Most   modern   web   applications   need   databases   to   store   structured   data,
